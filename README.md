# Law-of-Memory-Recall
Quantitative Life Science project, Physics of Data MSc.

## Abstract
Human cognition is typically considered to be too complex and unpredictable to be described by universal mathematical laws. Indeed, in this work we show that human memory can be described by universal laws derived from first principles. We propose an associative search process consisting in a deterministic walk on random graphs defined by the structure of memory representations. The corresponding model can be analytically solved, resulting in a parameter-free equation describing the relationship between the number of recalled items and the number of items in memory. This prediction was verified by designing a specific experimental protocol, which involves both free recall and recognition.


## Notes
`batch04` is not complete, so in the code I skip it.
